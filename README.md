# Making APIs

* #### This API storage the ranking of some most famous Programming Languages, as well as, their images and titles.

* In this challenge we used a framework called [`Spring`](https://start.spring.io/) and a database for storage the API's body, the [`MongoDB`](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/org/6425a07a0a6b55277d6cd9a5/projects).

* Also in the challenge we finished the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) and the `json` was updated to be ordered by the ranking.
